### PROJECT-IV: Group-7 presents - 
# Conestoga Connects

Solution startup notes:
Make sure to run the server project always!

Branch notes:
Main branch/ Master: Only has the final product once ready for deployment

Dev: has the latest working piece of code

Dev splits into Dev backend and Dev GUI, both of which are downstream to dev, and the names are pretty descriptive
These branches (dev-backend, dev-gui) are further split into individual branches of team members. This ensures a smooth workflow on the repository.

The testing branches are downstream of Dev too, and are only used for testing purposes, nothing else.


<I> This project was created as a part of the course: COMP72020 (Project IV: Mobile and Networked Systems) in Winter 2024 (Bachelor of Computer Science, Level 4) </I>
